The factory pattern is a creational pattern and is used when the object that is to be created is unknown until runtime.
The factory will determine what class is needed and handles the instantiation of that class.
It is used to create multiple different types of objects. These objects can be of many different classes.
An example of this would be the shape factory discussed in class. The factory class deals with determining what 
shape needs to be instantiated by using a switch. Once determined, the shape factory will instantiate the specified class/shape.
