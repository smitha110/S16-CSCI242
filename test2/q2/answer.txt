What are namespaces?

Namespaces are a way to organize or group classes together to avoid conflict with other classes with the same name.

Why are namespaces used?

Namespaces are used to avoid conflicts with other classes with the same name.
Using namespaces allows you to group classes together just like you would with files inside a folder.
Classes can be accessed using it's fully qualified name (the namespace assigned to the class) or by renaming it using "use qualified/name/Class' as NewClassName.
This allows you to work with classes that other developers have created without having to modify conflicting class names.
