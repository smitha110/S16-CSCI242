The purpose of a router is to direct the web application based on an action.
In MVC, the controller routes the request based on a specified action. 
The controller will get the necessary information from the model, do any needed 
logic, and direct/route the application to whereever it needs to go. On an Apache Web 
Server, the router will direct the applicaton's request based on the controller's 
action.
